Plugin for the jstree www.jstree.com tree component that provides a grid extension to the tree.

Allows any number of columns, and can use any property of the node to display data in the grid

Usage:
1) Include jquery and jstree in your page, as usual
2) Include jstreegrid.js
<script src="/path/to/jstreegrid.js"></script>
<link href="treegrid.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"> 

3) Include grid as a plugin
$("div#id").jstree({
..
	plugins: ["core","ui",...,"grid"],
..
})

4) Include relevant parameters. 
$("div#id").jstree({
..
	plugins: ["core","ui",...,"grid"],
	grid: {
		columns: [{},{},...,{}],
		width: 25
	} 
..
});

The options are as follows:
- width: default width for a column for which no width is given. If no width is given, the default is 25px
- columns: an array of columns to create, on order. Each entry is an object with the following parameters:
	width: width of the column in pixels.
	header: string to use as a header for the column.
	cellClass: a CSS class to add to each cell in this column (except for the header)
	headerClass: a CSS class to add to the header cell in this column
	value: the attribute on the node to use as the value for this cell

Value is the name of the attribute whose content will be used. Thus, if you have a node whose data is given by:
{data: "My Node", attr: {price: "$10"}}
and we want the price value ($10) to be in column 1, then we have a config of:
grid: {
	columns: [
		{width: 50, header: "Nodes"},
		{width: 30, header: "Price", value: "price"}
	]
}
